# Numerator

Figma plugin. Easy way to numerate frames.

## Usage
Numerate using 2 flags: {current}, {total} and 3 direction modes: → ↘ ↓
{current} – to place current frame number
{total} – to place number of all slides.

Only those objects in which either the frame name or the text layer content content has the flags are considered.

If after running the plugin you have not changed the replaced content it will be updated after plugin re-run (no need to add flags again).

Duplicate the frames with which the "Numerator" has already worked and run the plugin again – this also works like a charm (no need to add flags again).
