## Usage
Numerate using 2 flags: {current} – to place current frame number and {total} – to place number of all slides.

3 modes of direction: → ↘ ↓

If after running the plugin you have not changed the replaced content it will be updated automatically – you can add more frames and re-run the plugin again.

Only those objects in which either the frame name or the text layer content content has the flags are considered.
